My name is Annabelle Blasiol, I am twenty years old and in my junior year of college. I have my Associates degree in general studies with a specialization in psychology. I am now working towards getting my Bachelor’s in psychology with a minor in childhood studies. 

I attended Germanna Community College from seventeen years old till I was nineteen when I graduated. Once I graduated I applied to transfer to Christopher Newport University, where I currently attend as a psychology major. 

I am a Psychology major to further my knowledge on how humans work, no matter the field I choose to go into having this knowledge will help. While the path I am planning on taking is becoming a children’s counselor that is not my only option with my degree. A few other options I’ve been considering are, A preschool teacher, a school counselor, a social worker, and many more
 
While I was waiting to hear if I got accepted into Christopher Newport University I took a gap semester. During that Gap semester I had three jobs, the first being a lunch buddy in an elementary school, my main purpose was to monitor a lunch room full of children so the teachers could take a break. After working there for 3 months I was offered a job at the daycare down the road, they wanted to make sure I could keep my previous job so I worked at both the school and the daycare. Not long after starting my daycare job I was offered another job at the school as a morning Paraprofessional in a kindergarten classroom. I held all three jobs from February till the end of school year. Once the jobs in the elementary school ended I picked up more hours at the daycare up until my last week before moving to Newport News.

Prior to working at the school, I got my foot in the door when I was around sixteen. At this time, I would volunteer to watch the children of the teachers who were apart of the pta. While I don’t have much official volunteer hours I still like to pride myself on always being a helping hand. I have always watched my sisters, cousins, and niece anytime my family members need. 

I enjoy spending time with my family as I am incredibly close to them, before moving away most of my spare time was spent going out with them. Rather we were just running errands, going out to eat, or going to some type of event it was always a day I enjoyed. Now that I am 3 hours away from them there is a lot of texting and calling to keep in touch. With how big my family is there is always something to be told.

When I’m not spending time with my family I enjoy 
*embroidery

*swimming 

*baking

While I’m definitely not the best at any of these things I still find joy in them. Luckily for me, these are the things I can do no matter where I live. If I ever need a pick me up you will probably find me at the beach or in a kitchen. 

For now, I will learn how to adapt to new environments, new people, and a new schedule, it will be difficult but I think I will enjoy living at CNU. While I may have to take frequent trips home to visit my family, the daycare, and my friends I am excited to start a new life and make a new support system and close friends.
