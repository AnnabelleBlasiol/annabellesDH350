When I began this class, I had pretty much no concept of what digital humanities was, over the course of this semester my knowledge has grown immensely. While Digital Humanities is still difficult to explain to an outsider looking in, this is what I do know. Digital Humanities is a form of humanities that involves technology, not just using a word document to write about history but incorporating technological aspects such as a timeline, mapping tools, etc., the possibilities are endless.

 

While I often struggled to keep up with the readings, I did learn a lot from them. One of the one’s I enjoyed reading the most was “Nielson Norman Group, “Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence”” after reading that article I have learned what type of text scanning pattern I tend to use. Ever since I read it I have thought about it whenever I am reading something.

 I also try to keep it in mind when I am writing in order to get the most important information to catch each and every viewer’s attention. Many of the other readings helped me to understand what is classified as digital humanities, often times when I got confused in class there was a reading that would help me to better understand.

 

I began this class confused due to how much of this class was entirely new to me, for example, I’ve never heard of digital humanities before this class, I’ve never used github, and I’ve never had to write a grant. While in the moment I struggled, I always enjoyed seeing the outcome of my hard work in the end. When I made my “about me blog” I was so satisfied when I saw my final product. Throughout the course of creating my grant I made lots of accomplishments that I had been nervous about prior to completing them.

 

While creating each part of the grant; the proposal, the lean canvas and ideation, the first draft, and the final draft was such an interesting process. I was able to watch my work come together as my confidence over the final grant grew. I enjoyed how the assignment was split up throughout the course, all these smaller assignments worked towards a bigger assignment. The way this course was split up allowed the students to not be so overwhelmed by the coursework.

Over the course of this class, I have made lots of improvement on my writing, maybe not the physical writing itself but I have learned multiple different writing styles and learned how to branch out a little while writing.  I believe that through peer reviews and my meetings with Dr. Stover I have been able to get advice on how I could improve my writing skills.

 

I have gained an interest in Digital Humanities in the span on the five months in this class. There is a lot that digital humanities can be useful for, to me, I see it as an educational tool. As I am an interactive learning having Digital Humanities projects as a form of learning about history is an amazing resource. I am glad I got the opportunity to take this course.
