The project I am reviewing is the “Timeline of Developmental Theory”, there is no real name for who made this project, but the username given is “cstemple”. This is a timeline about developmental theorists,  including their theories, their birth and death year, as well as a brief summary of the ideas they contributed. 

This project touches in the humanistic field of history, while it is talking about psychology and theories, it is focused on the history of each theorist. This project allows people who are interested in history or psychology to get a basic understanding of the history of developmental psychology. It does well to demonstrate how it engages with the humanities discipline by exhibiting aspects of both history and Development Psychology.

This timeline may not advance knowledge about the subject matter, but it may be able to help people who are learning on their own. Finding a place to start in such a large field can be complex, and while this project does provide information, it is at the most basic level. While this project tells us each child development theory along with who created it, it does not go into detail. It uses a streamlined approach to learning, layering data in an easy-to-understand way, therein making it best for those who are new to the fields of History, Psychology, and Humanities. If they were looking for a more advanced timeline, they could have included information such as, when they published their theories and more information on the theories themselves. However, this is a good starting point for people who are new to psychology. 

The Timeline of Developmental Theory uses a website called “timeline toast” to make this project a reality. It has three different formats, default view, wide view, and fullscreen mode. Another format you can toggle to is list, this completely changes it from a timeline into a simple list. It also allows you to browse the timeline and adjust the start or end years.

 It uses this technology to advance its goals and make it easier to learn about the different thinkers and theorists. This is a great feature for a teaching situation where only the years 1750-1900 are important. The use of technology is nicely demonstrated, as it allows the viewers to have a visual aid which could help in the memorization of developmental psychology information displayed. However, I do believe that traditional scholarship could easily replicate this technology, as it is not too complex that it cannot be copied. The website is easy to navigate as it is small, and everything is maintained in one page

Something that could’ve been improved would be adding more context in certain places. For example, the years provided for each theorist has no context saying it was their birth and death years. I had to figure this out on my own, as my initial thought when I saw the years was that it had something to do with the length of their career. To me, this project is less of a timeline of the theories and more of a timeline of the theorists, since it does not actually mention which theories came first.

Reviewing the “Timeline of Developmental Theory” has allowed me to reflect on what I want my project to look like. It has allowed me to see errors that I will be able to correct in my own timeline as well as things I would like to integrate into my timeline. I will be sure to correctly label each part of my timeline and provide context as to what numbers mean what. Something else I noticed when going through the timeline is that the theories may be added upon by a later theorist, but the timeline does not do well to reference the originating theorist and what theory inspiration was drawn from. I feel as if this takes away from the project as a whole, as it diminishes the origin of the theory and can make it more confusing for the reader.

This is a much smaller project in comparison to how I imagine my own, however that is not a bad thing. This project includes a few lesser-known theorists that I haven’t heard of. For my project, I plan to include early philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato, demonstrating where some other theorists may have drawn inspiration from. I also plan to have a link for each theorist to lead to their own page with more information about them and their theories when selected. In addition, I plan on cross referencing my theories, as a lot of them stem from one another. While the “Timeline of Development Theory” does include mentions of theories being inspired by others, it doesn’t include what aspects are inspired. Something that could’ve been done to improve this portion of the project would be adding a link attached to the name of the theorist they were influenced by to lead back to their page. This would give credit to the origin of an idea, as well as paint a more well-rounded picture of the history of a certain theory. If people are skipping around and they miss a theorist, they have an automatic way to find them and compare the two theories.

A few things the “Timeline of Developmental Theory” has inspired me to include in my project are having different formats or views, having the options to scroll through the years, and including personal information such as their birth and death years. I may also include the more significant theories that a theorist either invented or contributed to. Something reviewing this project has taught me is that adding as much information as possible is important. Giving context and explaining different aspects of a theorist’s career can make it easier to understand when and where an idea originated from. When I was reviewing the “Timeline of Developmental Theory”, I was often left to figure out what the information meant on my own. In my own timeline, the reader would not have to do this, as I would provide as much explanation and context as possible.
